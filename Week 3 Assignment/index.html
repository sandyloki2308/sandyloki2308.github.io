          <h2>BRIYANI</h2>
             Even thought cooking briyani is a challenge, and there isn't much room for experimentation, chefs say the rice preparation evokes nostalgia and has managed to ramain a favourite time after time
             there can be nothing better than a plateful of the quintessenrial briyani is not just a wholesome meal,but also evokes nostalgia as a royal and iconic dish.Originally from persia,and introducted
 	     in india by Mughal rules,the dish is a delight to eat and a challenge for chefs to prepare.In a perfect pot of briyani every grain of rice is separate, yet infused with aromas of various spices and 
             has meat or vegetables paired with it.Celebrity chef Ajay Chopra is not wrong in saying that cooking a perfect briyani is always a nail-biting finish.Every time make a briyani,it's a new challenge 
	     because this is one dish that can toss you out every single time,right from the quality of rice to the quality of meat and its cooking time.It is always a wait-and-watch game he says.
	     Obviously experience helps you to get it right but is a nail-biting finish.But it's such a joy when the lid is opened and the rice is fragrantly separate and well-cooked,says the Mumbai-based food expert.
	     But with people craving innovation and experimentation,how is the briyani faring against competition from exotic rice preparations like pilaf,risotto.or the traditional and comparatively easier to make pulao?
	     Every rice preparation whether it is pulao or risotto has its own unique characteristics.What makes briyani stand apart is the slow dum cooking process says Chopra who hosts the Northern Flavours show on television.
	     All the other rice preparation like risotto are cooked together with the meat or flavourings,but briyani generally is a complex mix of flavours which is layered and the stronger flavours rise from the bottom and
	     travel to the top he explains.US-based Indian chef Aarthi sampath,Who recently won a popular cuilnary competition Beat Bobby Flay by making her signature briyani shares a similar view.I feel elated for the opportunity
	     to represent indian culture in the western market.Briyani is still not very well-making it she says.Her memories of the dish go back to her childhood when her mother cooked Sunday lunch of heavenly goat briyani and 
	     fried chicken.The family would sit on the floor and goege on the food while watching their favourite TV serial.In NYC there are so many briyani stores feeding hungry school kids,offices and families says the chef who
	     worked in a michelin-starred indian restaurant in new york before starting her own food truck in seattle.According to her briyani has its origins in persian cooking.The Mughal emperors of indian partook of this delicious 
	     rice concoction during their royal feasts. Briyani originated in Iral.The islamic persians introduced briyani to the world. The world birian means fried before cooking.The Mughal who set shop in Calcutta,Hyderabad and 
	     Lucknow had their own versions of briyani influences she says.
